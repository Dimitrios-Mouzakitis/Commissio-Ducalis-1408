# Commissio-Ducalis-1408
This Digital Scholarly Edition provides a semi-diplomatic transcription and structured TEI encoding of the Venetian ducal commission of 1408 to the Sindici Inquisitori, preserved in two manuscript witnesses. The project aims to model the linguistic, documentary, and administrative characteristics of the original sources in a machine-readable form, enabling further palaeographic, historical, and prosopographical research.
