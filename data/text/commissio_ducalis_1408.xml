            <p xml:lang="en">This digital scholarly edition provides a semi-diplomatic transcription
               and structured TEI encoding of the ducal commission of 1408, preserved in two
               manuscript witnesses. The project aims to model the linguistic, documentary, and
               administrative characteristics of the original sources in a machine-readable form,
               enabling further palaeographic, historical, and prosopographical research.</p>

         <editorialDecl>
            <p xml:lang="en">The transcription follows a semi-diplomatic method grounded in direct
               examination of the manuscripts. Orthography, word division, scribal habits, and the
               formal structure of chancery Latin have been preserved. Page and line breaks,
               rubrication, and internal chapter divisions are retained to mirror the documentary
               layout. Capitalization has been regularised, restricting capital letters to proper
               nouns (persons, places, and peoples), and punctuation has been standardised to
               facilitate reading while maintaining the text’s original rhythm.</p>
            <normalization method="silent">
               <p xml:lang="en">Orthographic normalization has been deliberately limited. Original
                  spellings (e.g., <q>Corphoy</q>, <q>offitialis</q>, <q>havere</q>, <q>comune</q>)
                  are reproduced. The fluctuating use of <q>u/v</q> and <q>i/j</q> has been left
                  largely unchanged, except where minimal harmonisation was necessary for internal
                  consistency. Scribal abbreviations and suspensions have been silently expanded to
                  improve readability, following conventions used in comparable Digital Scholarly
                  Editions of Venetian documents. No modernization of vocabulary or syntax has been
                  applied.</p>

                  but remains close to the manuscript usage. No modern quotation marks have been

                     Ages and lasted until 1797. The Doge was elected for life by the Venetian
                     aristocracy through a complex electoral process designed to prevent corruption
                     and concentration of power. Although early Doges held significant political and
                     military authority, over time their powers were severely limited by the
                     Republic’s councils, making the Doge primarily a ceremonial and unifying figure
                     representing the dignity and continuity of Venice.</desc>

                     Venetian Republic responsible for overseeing the security of the Gulf of Venice
                     and the main maritime routes of the eastern Adriatic. Often stationed at Corfu,
                     he commanded a squadron of galleys tasked with protecting merchant convoys,
                     combating piracy, and supervising the coastal fortresses and ports under
                     Venetian control. The Capitano del Golfo also held limited administrative and
                     judicial authority in maritime matters, ensuring compliance with Venetian naval
                     laws. His office was essential to maintaining safe navigation and asserting
                     Venice’s maritime dominance across the Adriatic, which was regarded as the
                     “Venetian Gulf.”</desc>

                     officials such as the Capitano del Golfo, the Sopracomito was responsible for
                     the discipline, navigation, and combat readiness of his vessel and crew. His
                     duties included enforcing maritime regulations, overseeing trade or military
                     missions, and ensuring the galley’s provisioning and maintenance. The position
                     required both seafaring expertise and administrative ability, as the
                     Sopracomito represented Venice’s naval authority in the ports and waters of the

                  <note xml:lang="en">Venice, in the early 15th century, was the political and
                     administrative centre of a dominant maritime republic, controlling key trade
                     routes across the Eastern Mediterranean. As the seat of the major councils and
                     the ducal chancery, it was the place where the Sindici Inquisitori received
                     their commission, swore their oath, and to which they were required to return
                     with their findings. Venice thus served both as the point of departure and the
                     final locus of accountability for their mission.</note>

                  <note xml:lang="en">Corfu, in the early 15th century, was a key Venetian
                     stronghold in the Levante, controlling the maritime routes linking the Adriatic
                     to the Ionian Sea. After more than a century under the Kingdom of Naples, the
                     island was secured by Venice in 1386 amid weakening Angevin authority.
                     Throughout the following centuries it developed into the most important
                     Venetian outpost outside the Adriatic. In 1408 it constituted one of the
                     primary stations of the Sindici Inquisitori assigned to Romania, who were
                     instructed to examine the conduct of local rectors and officials and to
                     collaborate with the local Consiglio in their inquiries.</note>

                     Venetian strongholds in Morea, acquired in 1209 and thereafter developed into a
                     major commercial and military station controlling the passage between the
                     Ionian and Aegean Seas. In the 1408 commission, Modon appears as the principal
                     stop of the state galley transporting the Sindici inquisitori to the Levante.
                     It was the place where the four officials were instructed to disembark and
                     separate, with one pair proceeding to Crete and the other continuing their
                     itinerary through the possessions of Romania. This role highlights the city's
                     logistical importance within the maritime routes that connected Venice with its
                     overseas dominions.</note>

                  <note xml:lang="en">Crete, in the early 15th century, was Venice’s most valuable
                     overseas possession, serving as a key hub for trade between Europe, Asia, and
                     North Africa. Its agricultural wealth, particularly in grain, olive oil, and
                     wine, played a crucial role in the Venetian economy. Under Venetian rule since
                     1217, the island was heavily fortified to protect maritime routes, but
                     persistent local resistance, influenced by Byzantine traditions, led to
                     frequent revolts. For the Sindici assigned to Crete, the island was the primary
                     field of investigation. They were required to audit the several rectorates,
                     oversee fiscal administration, examine complaints from local inhabitants, and
                     ensure that communal resources had not been misused by Venetian
                     officials.</note>

                     Venetian possessions in the Aegean during the early 15th century. Although the
                     island had been fragmented among feudal lords after 1204, Venice progressively
                     consolidated its authority, achieving full control in 1390. Chalcis, the
                     island’s capital, developed into a major administrative and military center
                     safeguarding the maritime routes between the Eastern Mediterranean and the
                     Black Sea. In the commissio of 1408, Negroponte occupies a central logistical
                     and administrative role: repeated instructions address the bailo, the captain,
                     and the locally stationed galley, which was formally assigned to transport the
                     Sindici between the various locations under inquiry. The Sindici were also
                     ordered to collaborate closely with the local rectorate and to investigate
                     fiscal, judicial, and military matters crucial to Venice’s hold over the
